# Tailwind Practice Wireframe

This project is a **practice wireframe** built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).  
It **does not follow any specific UI design**, and the main goals were:

- Practicing **responsive design**
- Exploring and implementing **dark mode support**
- Getting more comfortable with Tailwind utility classes
- Trying out the `@apply` directive in custom CSS for reusability

> 📱 This wireframe was built with mobile-first responsiveness in mind.
